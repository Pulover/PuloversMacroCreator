	Function: Common_Fields()
		The following fields appear on some of the Command Windows below and will behave the same for all, therefore will be omitted from their parameters.

	Parameters:
		Repeat - How many times to execute action.  
			This field accepts [Variables & Functions](p8-Variables.html).
		Delay - Time to wait before the next command line.  
			This field accepts [Variables & Functions](p8-Variables.html).
		Control - Selects the target control to send the command. Use the Get button to easily find a control's name: Point the mouse to its location and Right-Click on it. To operate upon a control's HWND (window handle), leave the Control parameter blank and specify ahk_id %ControlHwnd% for the WinTitle parameter.  
			This field accepts [Variables & Functions](p8-Variables.html).
		Window - Title/Class/Process/ID/ProcessID of target window for control command. The DropdowndList defines which information will be taken from a windown when using the *Get* button.  
			**Extra Parameters**: The first parameter is WinTitle, you can add one or more extra parameters separating them by commas:
			> WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText.
			You can omit any of those parameters, including WinTitle.  
			This field accepts [Variables & Functions](p8-Variables.html).

	Function:Assign_Variable()
		Assigns a Variable to a Value using the chosen operator.

	Parameters:
		Output Variable - Name of the Variable in which to store the contents.
		Operator - Operator to use in the assignment.
		Content - Text, Variables or Function to be assigned.  
		Expression - If enabled will execute the [Eval()](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/15675-monster) function on the contents to solve functions and math expressions. This is especially useful to modify variables values without the need to create more Assignments. It also allows you to assign the variable to a function result like the in the *Functions* window, or use a function inside an expression.
			> X := %FoundX% + 100 ; Assigns X to the value of FoundX + 100.
			> X := InStr(AutoHotkey, y) + 4 ; Assigns X to 14.
			> X := Array(1, 2, 3) ; Creates an array.
			> Y := X[1] ; Assigns Y to the first value in the X array.
			> Y += 1 ; Increments Y by 1.
			*Note*: To keep this option enabled by default go to Options Menu > Settings > Misc. and check the option.
		Copy - Copies the variable's contents to the Clipboard.
		Reset - Erases the variable's contents.

	Remarks:
		Since Playback uses a function to dereference variables before assigning, variables references should be enclosed in percent signs. The references will be corrected for the exported script.
		> MyVar := %A_Now%

/*!
	Function: Functions()
		Executes a Function and assigns the result to a Variable.  

	Parameters:
		Output Variable (Optional) - Name of the Variable in which to store the contents.
		Use Function from External File - Check this option to select an AutoHotkey Script File (.ahk) containing one or more functions to be used. This feature requires [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) installed.  
			See Remarks below for more information.  
		Function Name - A valid AHK Built-in Function name or the name of a Function in the selected external .ahk file.
		Comma separated parameters - The list of parameters for the function.  
			*Notes*:  
			* Input only the parameters values, without parenthesis.  
			* Since Playback uses a function to dereference variables before assigning, variables references should be enclosed in percent signs. The syntax will be corrected for the exported script.  
			* Literal commas should be escaped (also valid for functions inside commands).
			> SubStr(This is`, a literal comma, 13)
			* It's not necessary to use "quotes" for string values.  
			* Omitted parameters will use their default values unless they are in-between other values.  
			> RegExReplace(%Haystack%, %Needle%, , , 10)
			The function above have 6 possible parameters. In this example parameters 3 and 4 will have blank values and parameter 6 will use the default value.  

	Remarks:
		AutoHotkey's Built-in Functions are supported by default. You can also run functions from external AutoHotkey Script Files if you have [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) installed.  

	Extra:
		### External Functions
			If a *Standard Library File* is configured it will be automatically loaded when a new command is added.  
			
			When you load an external file the program will try to detect possible function names and list them in *Function Name* field. If the function you want doesn't appear in the list you can still type it manually.  
			
			When this feature is used in Playback it will create a temporary .ahk file in the same directory where Macro Creator is installed and run it using AutoHotkey. The result will be copied to the Output Variable and the script will be closed.  
			
			If the ahk file containing the function have #include directives they must contain the absolute path for the included files (e.g.: #include c:\lib\myfunction.ahk).  
			
			Since those functions are not loaded with Macro Creator they may take longer to execute.

/*!
	Function: Internet_Explorer()
		Creates an Internet Explorer COM Object and adds automation commands for it.

	Parameters:
		Commands - The dropdown list contains some of the most used IE Methods and Properties. Select the correct one to manipulate the browser window or page elements.
		Set / Get - Chooses whether to set a value to the object or to copy the element's value to a variable.
		Method / Property - If you type a command that is not recognized by the program you have to select whether it's a Method or a Property.
		Value - Value to be used by a Method or to be set to a Property. This field accepts [Variables & Functions](p8-Variables.html).
		Output Variable - The name of the variable in which to store the value of a Property.
		Page Element / Index - Sets the page element and index on which to perform the action. The dropdown list selects the method to be used to identify the element. Use the *Get* button to easily identify elements of the page.
		Wait for page to load - Check this option when you expect the page to change after the command. This will execute a function after it to wait for the new page to be completely loaded before continuing, avoiding errors.

	Remarks:
		When you close the application, all references to Active Windows will be lost, to continue working using saved project files edit one of the lines and use the dropdown list to select the window you'll work with.

		It might be necessary to set *Focus* to an object before performing and action like *Click*.  
		
		Although not all Methods and Properties are listed it may still be possible to use them with the correct syntax. For more information on methods and properties please check Microsoft MSDN website.  
		
		To set a blank value use a pair of quotes: ""

/*!
	Function: COM_Interface()
		Select Application (Advanced) allows to create any COM Object and add commands in AutoHotkey's dotted syntax format.

	Parameters:
		CLSID - CLSID or human-readable Prog ID of the COM object to create.
		Connect - Tries to connect to the Last Active COM Object registered to the selected CLSID to be used for the current session.
		Handle - Name of a Handle that will point to the object.
		Output Variable (Optional) - Name of the variable in which to store the result of COM Script.
		COM Script - Command line in AutoHotkey's dotted syntax to execute using the object. **Ommit the Handle from the beginning of the string**.  

	Remarks:
		You can enter multiple commands one by line (you can't assign variables this way).  
		
		The syntax for COM commands is the same as in AutoHotkey scripts except for:  
			* Variables MUST be enclosed in percent signs.
			* Strings must NOT be enclosed in quotes.
		
		To set a blank value use a pair of quotes: ""
		
		When you close the application, all references to Active Objects will be lost. To continue working using saved project files you must reconnect to the application by either editing one of the lines containing each handle and use the *Connect* button to re-create all references, or assigning the Handle to a ComObj function, usually ComObjActive(), though it will not work on all applications.
		
		To assign a value to the command use the *:=* operator. For example:
		> ActiveCell.Value := 100
		
		Self-references inside parameters are supported. In such cases **you must NOT ommit the Handle** from the parameter.
		> Range(Xl.Selection, Xl.Selection.Offset(5, 5)).Select
		
		To create a SafeArray enclose the values in blocks [].
		> Selection.Subtotal(2, -4157, [4, 5], 1, 0, 1)
		
		To use *ComObjMissing()* leave the parameter blank:
		> Function(1, 2, , 3, , 5)
		An exported script from the above example would be like:
		> Function(1, 2, ComObjMissing(), 3, ComObjMissing(), 5)
