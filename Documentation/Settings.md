## Introduction

All settings are saved to *MacroCreator.ini* and User Global Variables are saved to *UserGlobalVars.ini*, both files are located inside *AppData\MacroCreator* by default. To make **Macro Creator** portable you can copy those files to the same directory of *MacroCreator.exe* and it will use its own folder instead of AppData.

## Recording

See [Record Page](p2-Record.html#recording-options).

## Playback

See [Playback Page](p3-Playback.html#playback-options).

## Defaults

**Mouse Coordinates**: Sets coordinate mode for Mouse commands and records to be relative to either the active window or the screen. This option is global and will affect both Recording and Playback so it should be set before adding any commands for the project.  
*Note*: This setting will be saved to the PMC file.

**Default Mouse Delay**: Sets the default delay for each Mouse Command. This affects new commands added from the Mouse Command window and will only affect recording if 'Timed Intervals' is disabled.

**Default Window Delay**: Sets the default delay for each Window (Set) Command. This affects new commands added from the Window Command window and Recording.

**Max History per Macro**: Sets the maximum History steps to keep for each macro. Changing this might have little impact in performance. It's recommended to restart Macro Creator after changing this setting.

**Clear History**: Clears and resets History for all Macros.

**Default Script Editor**: Sets a default editor to open Script with the *Edit Script* button in the **Preview** window.

**Default Macro File**: If a valid file with a PMC code is set it will be loaded on program start up.

**Standard Library File**: Sets an AutoHotkey script file to be loaded automatically in the *Functions* window.

**Set As Default Hotkeys**: If checked the current Hotkeys will be loaded on each run of the program and when 'Default Settings' are loaded.

## Screenshots

**Draw Button**: Selects the Draw Button to be used for Screenshots tool and Get Area in Image Search.

**Line Width (Px)**: Defines the pixel width of the rectangle when using the Screenshots tool.

**Capture on release**: Captures Screenshots when the Draw button is released.

**Press Enter to capture**: Waits for the user to press Enter to confirm the rectangle area of the Screenshot. Enabling this option allows you to adjust the search/capture area using hotkeys (**Ctrl + Arrow keys** to move the selection area and **Shift + Arrow keys** to resize it).

**Screenshots Directory**: Selects the default folder for Screenshots taken.

## General

**Disable Window Shortcuts**: Disable Shortcuts for commands in the main window.

**Allow Multiple Instances**: Determines whether Macro Creator is allowed to run concurrent instances.

**Remove Theme from Toolbars**: Removes the current theme colors from the main window toolbars (you must restart the application to apply the changes).

**Use Expression by default for Variables Assignment**: Determines whether the *Expression* option will be enabled by default for new Variable Assignments.

**Allow Dragging Rows**: Enables / Disables row dragging with mouse in the Macro lists.

**Show Colors & Help Marks for Loops and Statements**: When activated rows inside Loops and text of rows inside Statements will be shown in colors, also braces and wildcards will be placed in front of command's index as representation to help visualize which rows are nested. Braces represent Loops and Wildcards represent If Statements, so for example *N* \*{\*{ is equivalent to:  
> If
> {
> 	Loop
> 	{
> 		If
> 		{
> 			Loop
> 			{
> 				N
> 			}
> 		}
> 	}
> }
You can also click on the *Index* Column Header to turn this option On/Off.  
You can change the default colors clicking on the color shown here and picking one from anywhere on the screen.  

**Show Indentation for Loops and Statements**: When activated Actions inside Loops or Statements will be shown with indentation.  
You can also double-click on the *Action* Column Header to turn this option On/Off.  

**Virtual Keys**: System keys and Modifiers that will be recognized during Recording and when Capture keys is enabled.

## User Global Variables

Here you can define global variables that will be available during Playback. They may be used as constants so you can always call them from inside a command.  

User defined variables are saved to an INI file in the AppData\MacroCreator folder (it can also be edited in external text editors).

Format is the same used for non-expression assignments in AutoHotkey or the one found in standard INI files.  

They can also be included in exported scripts by checking *Global Variables* option in the [Export Window](p5-Export.html).  

You can separate your variables in groups using INI format Sections with title enclosed in brocks. Use the button in the Export Window to select which Variables or Sections will be exported.  

Example of *User Global Variables* list:

> [Section1]
> aVar1 = Value1
> aVar2 = Value3
> aVar3 = Value2
> [Section2]
> bVar1 = Value1
> bVar2 = Value3
> bVar3 = Value2
