## Files

**New**: Starts a new Project.

**Open**: Opens a Project (it can be a PMC file or an AHK file containing a PMC Code).

**Save / Save As**: Saves current Project in a PMC file including all non-empty Macros.

**Export**: Opens the [Export Window](p5-Export.html) to save Macros in AHK Script Format.

**Preview**: Opens the [Preview Window](p6-Preview.html) which shows the current Macro in AHK Script.

**Options**: Opens the [Settings Window](p7-Settings.html) where it's possible to configure various options.

**List Variables**: Displays both internal and user-defined variables and their current contents.

## Record & Play

**Record**: Activates [Recording](p2-Record.html) Hotkeys.

**Activate Macros**: Activates [Playback](p3-Playback.html) Hotkeys.  

**Play Current Macro**: Runs currently selected Macro immediately without Hotkeys.  
*Note*: An *AutoPlay* feature is available via command line with the -a parameter: add -a or -a*N* (where *N* is the number of the Macro to run) as a parameter to run a Macro on program start-up. The example below would execute the second Macro in the project file.

> MacroCreator.exe SavedFile.pmc -a2

**Timer**: *Play once* runs currently selected Macro one time after the specified time. *Play every X (mili)seconds* runs it automatically and repeatedly at the specified time interval.  
The Abort Hotkey can be used to turn the Timer off.  
To have other Macros active during Timer check the *Always Active* option or right-click the TrayMenu icon and select **Play**.  

**Play From Selected Row**: If checked Playback will run each Macro from the first selected row in its list. Valid for all Playback commands.

**Play Until Selected Row**: If checked Playback will stop each Macro when the first selected row in its list is reached. Valid for all Playback commands.

**Play Selected Rows**: If checked Playback will only execute selected rows in each Macro. Valid for all Playback commands.

## Options

**Loop**: Number of loops to execute the currently selected Macro. If set to 0, the loop continues indefinitely until a break or return is encountered, or the Stop Key is pressed.

**Minimize to Tray**: If checked will hide the main window when *Record* or *Play* button is pressed. You can show the window again from the Tray Menu or the button in the Controls Bar.

**Display Controls**: If checked will display the [Controls Toolbar](p3-Playback.html#controls-toolbar) window when *Record* or *Play* button is pressed. It's a smaller window with Playback and Record buttons allow these commands using the mouse. You can also open it from the Macro Menu and TrayIcon.

**Capture Keys**: Enables Capturing of Key Presses on currently selected Macro List on the Main Window (this option does not affect Recording).

**Always Active**: Keeps all valid Hotkeys always activated (including Record & Playback).

**Shutdown options**: Selects an optional action to execute when Playback finishes.

**Context Sensitive Hotkeys**: Makes hotkeys work depending on the type of window that is active or exists. For more information see [AutoHotkey documentation](http://l.autohotkey.net/docs).

**Windows**: If checked adds the Windows Key as modifier to the Play Hotkey.

**Joystick**: Sets a joystick button to run the Macro. When activated the Play Hotkey box will switch to accept only joystick buttons. Only buttons are detected (axis, pov and others are not). The number before "Joy" is the joystick number and the number after it is the button number, so 2Joy1 is the second joystick's first button.

## Hotkeys

**Play**: Selects the Automatic Hotkey to execute the currently selected Macro

**Manual**: Selects the Manual Hotkey to execute the currently selected Macro step-by-step.

**Stop**: Selects the Hotkey to stop execution

**Pause**: Selects the Hotkey to pause execution

## Edit Commands

**Edit**: When only one row is selected it has tha same behavior as a double-click on a row to enter the command's window for editing. If more then one or no row is selected it will open an edit window where you change the target Control and Window, Repeat Loops or Delay for selected rows (or all rows if none is selected). If the all checkboxes are left unchecked it will remove Control and Window from selected rows. Control and Window will only affect Send, Click and Control commands.

**Cut Rows**: Cut selected Rows.

**Copy Rows**: Copy selected Rows.

**Paste Rows**: Paste copied Rows.

**Delete Rows**: Deletes selected Rows.

**Undo**: Undo one step in History of current Macro. History is individual for each Macro.

**Redo**: Redo one step in History of current Macro. History is individual for each Macro.

**Move Up**: Moves selected rows Up.

**Move Down**: Moves selected rows Down.

**Duplicate Rows**: Duplicates selected rows in the same list.

**Copy to...**: Copies selected rows to a different Macro tab.

**Edit Color Mark**: Opens a Color-Pick dialog to add or change a custom color mark in the first column cell of selected rows. Customized colors can be saved as a custom palette.

**Edit Comment**: Adds / Changes the comment to be displayed to the right of the line in Exported AHK Scripts on selected rows.

**Find / Replace**: This window helps finding and replacing parts of the commands in the *Details*, *Repeat*, *Delay*, *Control* and *Window* columns only. To select similar Command Types use the Select Menu.  
Note: Changing parameters of certain commands may cause misbehavior in Playback. Replace should be used only when and where necessary.

## Modify / Insert

**Insert from Box**: Inserts the command in the Hotkey box at the bottom in the current selected row (or at the end of the list if no row is selected).

**Repeat**: This field is used as a quick-edit to set the Repeat number to selected rows using the Apply buttons on the right.

**Delay (ms)**: Default delay between commands. The number set in this box will be automatically applied to a new added command (except for Mouse and Window commands which have individual default values that can be set in the [Settings Window](p7-Settings.html#defaults)). This field is also used as a quick-edit to set the Delay to selected rows using the Apply buttons on the right.

**Insert Box**: This box can be used to add commands to the list. Click in the box and press the buttons to add on the keyboard then press the Insert button to add them to the list (you can also use the Insert key as a shortcut when the focus is on the ListView).

**Insert Keystroke**: Alternative to the *Insert Box*. Opens a window where you can choose a keyboard key from a list. Double-click or click *Insert* to insert the key into the selected position. You can also choose to hold (Down) or release (Up) the key.

### General Remarks

When you click the Delete or Apply button (for Repeat or Delay) it will affect all selected rows, and if no row is selected it will apply to all rows in the current list.

When adding a new command either by Command Window, Capturing keys or the Insert button if no row is selected they will be added to the end of the list, if one row is selected they will be added on top of that row, and if more then one row is selected a new copy of the command will be added on top of each selected row, except for Loop, and If Statements which will add a Start on top of the first selected row and an End below the last selected row, and for Goto, Label, Break, Continue, Variable Assignment and Functions, which will add only one row on top of the first selected.

* *Action*: Description or name of the command.
* *Details*: Parameters or details of the command.
* *Repeat*: Number of times to execute the command.

**Show Colors && Help Marks for Loops and Statements**: Click on the *Index* Column Header or use the *View menu* to turn this option On/Off. When activated rows inside Loops and text of rows inside Statements will be shown in colors, also braces and wildcards will be placed in front of command's index as representation to help visualize which rows are nested. Braces represent Loops and Wildcards represent If Statements, so for example *N* \*{\*{ is equivalent to:  
> If
> {
> 	Loop
> 	{
> 		If
> 		{
> 			Loop
> 			{
> 				N
> 			}
> 		}
